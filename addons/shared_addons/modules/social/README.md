# PyroCMS: Social Module

The Social module is designed to allow third-party developers and PyroCMS itself to interact with 
various API's on your behalf, via the most common Authentication methods OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0.

As well as allowing module developers to have one central, uniform location to look for access tokens,
the Social module allows people to log in with, or register using their various social networks.

Want that "Log in with Twitter" button? Go for it:

    <a href="{{ url:site uri="social/session/twitter" }}">Log in with Twitter!</a>

You can use any of the providers you have set up in the Control Panel. To see how that works you can watch 
this video:

## Social Posting

If you click that lovely orange "Get Tokens" button then PyroCMS will authenticate a token for itself. This means PyroCMS can post new blog articles to your Twitter account or even a Facebook Page, and module developers can start to add things too.

More granular control over what will be done will be worked on later, as well as a log of what Social activity has happened in the past.
